# Batch vs Stream Processing

## Overview

Batch and stream processing are two different approaches to data processing. Batch processing handles data in large chunks at scheduled intervals, while stream processing handles data in real-time as it arrives.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of data processing concepts and system architecture.
