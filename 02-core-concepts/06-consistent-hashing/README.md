# Consistent Hashing

## Overview

Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table is resized. It's widely used in distributed systems for load balancing and data distribution.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of hashing concepts and distributed systems fundamentals.
