# CAP Theorem

## Overview

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. This fundamental trade-off shapes how we design distributed systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems concepts and consistency models.

## Notes

The CAP theorem is a useful framework for thinking about trade-offs, but it's not always black and white. Many systems provide different guarantees for different operations or data.
