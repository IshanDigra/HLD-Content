# Single Point of Failure

## Overview

A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) is a component of a system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail. Identifying and eliminating SPOFs is crucial for building reliable and fault-tolerant systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of system architecture and reliability concepts.
