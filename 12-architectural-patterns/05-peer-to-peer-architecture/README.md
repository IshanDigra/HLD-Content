# Peer-to-Peer Architecture

## Overview

Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture is a distributed system where nodes act as both clients and servers, sharing resources and responsibilities. It eliminates the need for central servers and provides decentralized communication.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems and network concepts.

## Notes

P2P architecture provides decentralization and fault tolerance but can be complex to implement and manage. Consider the trade-offs between decentralization and complexity when choosing P2P architecture.
