# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview

Event-driven architecture is a design pattern where system components communicate through events. It enables loose coupling, scalability, and responsiveness by decoupling producers and consumers of events.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of system architecture and messaging patterns.

## Notes

Event-driven architecture is ideal for systems that need to respond to real-time events and maintain loose coupling. Consider the trade-offs between complexity and flexibility when choosing event-driven architecture.
