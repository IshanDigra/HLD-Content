# B-Trees and B+ Trees

## Overview

B-trees and B+ trees are self-balancing tree data structures that maintain sorted data and allow searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. They are fundamental to database indexing and file systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of tree data structures and basic algorithms.

## Notes

B-trees are particularly well-suited for databases because they minimize disk I/O operations. B+ trees are often preferred for database indexes because they provide better sequential access performance.
