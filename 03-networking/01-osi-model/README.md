# OSI Model

## Overview

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It helps understand how different network protocols work together.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of computer networks and data communication concepts.
