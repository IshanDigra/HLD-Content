# TCP vs UDP

## Overview

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental transport layer protocols. Understanding their differences and trade-offs is essential for choosing the right protocol for different applications.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of networking concepts and transport layer protocols.
