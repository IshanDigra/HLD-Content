# Load Balancers

## Overview

Load balancers are devices or software that distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. They are essential for building scalable and highly available systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of client-server architecture and basic networking concepts.
