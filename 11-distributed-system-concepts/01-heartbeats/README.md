# Heartbeats

## Overview

Heartbeats are a mechanism used in distributed systems to detect failures and maintain liveness information. They involve periodic messages sent between nodes to indicate that a node is still alive and functioning.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems and failure detection concepts.
