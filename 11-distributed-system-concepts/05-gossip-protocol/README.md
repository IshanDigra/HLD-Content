# Gossip Protocol

## Overview

The gossip protocol is a communication pattern used in distributed systems for information dissemination. It's inspired by how gossip spreads in social networks and provides a robust way to propagate information across a network.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems and communication patterns.
