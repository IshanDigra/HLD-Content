# CRDTs

## Overview

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes and automatically resolve conflicts without requiring coordination. They enable eventual consistency in distributed systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems and data consistency concepts.
