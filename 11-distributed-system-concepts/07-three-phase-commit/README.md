# Three-Phase Commit

## Overview

The Three-Phase Commit (3PC) protocol is an improvement over the Two-Phase Commit protocol that reduces the blocking behavior of 2PC. It adds a third phase to handle coordinator failures more gracefully.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of the Two-Phase Commit protocol and distributed systems concepts.

## Notes

3PC reduces the blocking behavior of 2PC but adds complexity. Consider the trade-offs between performance and complexity when choosing between 2PC and 3PC.
