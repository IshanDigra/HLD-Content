# Two-Phase Commit Protocol

## Overview

The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is a distributed algorithm that ensures all nodes in a distributed system either commit or abort a transaction. It's a fundamental protocol for maintaining ACID properties in distributed transactions.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed transactions and consensus concepts.
