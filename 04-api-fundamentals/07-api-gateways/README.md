# API Gateways

## Overview

API Gateways act as a single entry point for all client requests to microservices. They handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, logging, and routing, making them essential for microservices architecture.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and API concepts.
