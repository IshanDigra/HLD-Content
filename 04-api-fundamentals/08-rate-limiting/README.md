# Rate Limiting

## Overview

Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of requests a client can make to an API. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects systems from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of API concepts and system performance considerations.
