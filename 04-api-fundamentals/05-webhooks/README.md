# Webhooks

## Overview

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that allow one system to notify another system about events in real-time. They enable event-driven architecture and decouple systems by allowing them to communicate asynchronously.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of HTTP protocols and event-driven architecture concepts.
