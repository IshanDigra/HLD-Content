# Change Data Capture

## Overview

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique that identifies and captures changes made to data in a database and delivers those changes in real-time to downstream systems. It's essential for maintaining data consistency across distributed systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of database concepts and event-driven architecture.
