# Pub/Sub

## Overview

The Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern is a messaging pattern where senders (publishers) don't program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, messages are published to topics without knowledge of who will consume them.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of messaging patterns and distributed systems concepts.

## Notes

Pub/Sub is ideal for event-driven architectures and systems that need to decouple producers and consumers. Consider the trade-offs between message delivery guarantees and performance.
