# Message Queues

## Overview

Message queues are a form of asynchronous communication where messages are stored in a queue until they can be processed. They enable decoupling between producers and consumers and provide reliability guarantees.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of asynchronous communication and system reliability concepts.
