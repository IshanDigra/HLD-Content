# Asynchronous Communications

## Overview

This section covers asynchronous communication patterns and technologies used in distributed systems. Asynchronous communication enables systems to be more scalable, resilient, and responsive by decoupling components.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of distributed systems concepts and messaging patterns.
