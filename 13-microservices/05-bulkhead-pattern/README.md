# Bulkhead Pattern

## Overview

The bulkhead pattern is a design pattern that isolates resources to prevent failures from cascading across the system. It's inspired by the bulkheads in ships that prevent water from flooding the entire vessel.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and fault tolerance concepts.
