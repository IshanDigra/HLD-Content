# Microservices

## Overview

This section covers the patterns and practices for building microservices systems. Microservices enable teams to develop, deploy, and scale services independently while maintaining system reliability and performance.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and distributed systems concepts.

## Learning Path
