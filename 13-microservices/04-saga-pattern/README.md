# Saga Pattern

## Overview

The saga pattern is a design pattern for managing distributed transactions in microservices. It breaks down a long-running transaction into a series of local transactions, each with a compensating action to undo the transaction if it fails.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and distributed transaction concepts.
