# Sidecar Pattern

## Overview

The sidecar pattern is a design pattern where a sidecar container runs alongside the main application container to provide cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, and security. It's commonly used in microservices and containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and containerization concepts.
