# Service Mesh

## Overview

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication in microservices. It provides features like load balancing, service discovery, and security without requiring changes to application code.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and networking concepts.
