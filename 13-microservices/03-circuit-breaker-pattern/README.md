# Circuit Breaker Pattern

## Overview

The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern that prevents cascading failures in distributed systems. It monitors calls to external services and opens the circuit when failures exceed a threshold, preventing further calls until the service recovers.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of microservices architecture and fault tolerance concepts.
