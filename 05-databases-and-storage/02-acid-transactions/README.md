# ACID Transactions

## Overview

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. Understanding these properties is essential for building reliable data systems.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of database concepts and transaction processing.

## Notes

ACID properties are fundamental to relational databases but can be relaxed in NoSQL databases for better performance. Understand the trade-offs when choosing between consistency and performance.
