# Quad Tree

## Overview

A quad tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. It's commonly used for spatial indexing and partitioning two-dimensional space recursively.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of tree data structures and spatial concepts.

## Notes

Quad trees are particularly useful for spatial queries and collision detection. They provide efficient access to spatial data but can become unbalanced with non-uniform data distribution.
