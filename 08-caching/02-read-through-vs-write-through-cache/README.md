# Read-Through vs Write-Through Cache

## Overview

Read-through and write-through are two fundamental caching patterns that determine how data flows between the cache and the underlying storage system. Understanding these patterns is crucial for implementing effective caching strategies.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of caching concepts and data consistency.
