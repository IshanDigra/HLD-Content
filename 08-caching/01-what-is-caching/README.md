# What is Caching

## Overview

Caching is a technique that stores frequently accessed data in fast storage to improve system performance. It reduces latency by serving data from cache instead of slower storage systems like databases.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of system performance and data access patterns.

## Notes

Caching is most effective when you have data that is accessed frequently and changes infrequently. Consider the trade-offs between cache size, hit rate, and data freshness.
