# Strong vs Eventual Consistency

## Overview

Strong consistency and eventual consistency are two different approaches to data consistency. Strong consistency ensures all nodes see the same data at the same time, while eventual consistency allows for temporary inconsistencies.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of data consistency and distributed systems concepts.
