# Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

## Overview

Vertical scaling (scaling up) involves adding more power to existing machines, while horizontal scaling (scaling out) involves adding more machines to handle increased load. Understanding these approaches is crucial for designing scalable systems.

## Prerequisites
