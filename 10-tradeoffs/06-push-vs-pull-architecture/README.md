# Push vs Pull Architecture

## Overview

Push and pull are two different approaches to data flow in distributed systems. Push architecture sends data to consumers, while pull architecture requires consumers to request data.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of data flow patterns and distributed systems concepts.
