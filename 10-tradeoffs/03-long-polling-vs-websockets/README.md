# Long Polling vs WebSockets

## Overview

Long polling and WebSockets are two different approaches to real-time communication. Long polling involves keeping a connection open for extended periods, while WebSockets provide persistent bidirectional communication.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of web protocols and real-time communication concepts.
