# Tradeoffs

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental tradeoffs in system design. Understanding these tradeoffs is crucial for making informed decisions about architecture, technology choices, and system characteristics.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of system design concepts and architectural patterns.
