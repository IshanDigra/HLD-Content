# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communications

## Overview

Synchronous and asynchronous are two different approaches to communication between system components. Synchronous communication waits for a response, while asynchronous communication doesn't block on responses.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of communication patterns and system design concepts.
