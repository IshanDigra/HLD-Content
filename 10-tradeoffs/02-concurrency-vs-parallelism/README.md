# Concurrency vs Parallelism

## Overview

Concurrency and parallelism are two different approaches to handling multiple tasks. Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks at the same time, while parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

Understanding of system performance and task execution concepts.
